# Hi there 👋 - I'm Henry Shires

I'm Henry Shires, a future Computer Engineer studying at Iowa State University who's invested in all things technology. I have experience with websites, web apps, mobile apps, and APIs and will soon begin my digital logic and circuits studies. I'm even a partial owner of an LLC, and when I'm not in the lab or working on my business, I'm most likely grooving with my buddies in the drumline.

- 🌐 I just finished designing a website for [ProjectDSM, the official re-creation of Des Moines, Iowa in Minecraft](https://projectdsm.org)
- 🖥️ I’m currently learning how to use React with various frameworks for mobile and web apps
- :baseball: I'm additionally developing an app for my project below!

### Featured Project: Casmium - Sports Analytics Software

Casmium enables sports teams to collect, upload, and view gameplay analytics to improve strategy and game performance. Users collect data in real-time on the mobile app, then upload to our database where they can view their data in our custom dashboard. Currently, Casmium only supports baseball data, but support for other sports is on the roadmap. The Casmium web platform and mobile app are both built in React (React.js and Native) while data and accounts are stored using Google's Firebase API.
