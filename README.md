# Hi there 👋 - I'm Henry Shires

I'm Henry Shires, a future Computer Engineer studying at Iowa State University who's invested in all things technology. I have experience with websites, web apps, mobile apps, and APIs and will soon begin my digital logic and circuits studies. I'm even a partial owner of an LLC, and when I'm not in the lab or working on my business, I'm most likely grooving with my buddies in the drumline.

- 📊 I just finished a simple data visualization to understand the basics of telling a story with the power of data, turning information into accurate and effective communication tools: [hcshires.com/data-map](https://hcshires.com/data-map)
- 🛰️ I'm currently working on the [Iowa State University CubeSat team, CySat](https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu/cysat), through the Make-2-Innovate Program with the Department of Aerospace Engineering. We're completing the final stages of a 10-year long mission to launch ISU's first CubeSat into space and transmit solar weather information to our ground station back on Earth!
