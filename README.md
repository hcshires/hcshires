# Hi there 👋 - I'm Henry Shires

I'm Henry Shires, a high school student invested in the world of software. I work on websites, webapps, mobile apps, and video game integrations. I'm familiar with using and integrating APIs and look forward to expanding my knowledge with use of popular web frameworks, SDKs, and libraries.

- 🌐 I just finished desgining a website for [ProjectDSM, the official re-creation of Des Moines, Iowa in Minecraft](https://projectdsm.org)
- 🖥️ I’m currently learning web development using Lavarel as well as React.js
- :baseball: I'm additionally developing an app in React Native for my project below!

### Featured Project: Casmium - Sports Analytics Software

Casmium enables sports teams to collect, upload, and view gameplay analytics to improve strategy and game performance. Users collect data in real-time on the mobile app, then upload to our database where they can view their data in our custom dashboard. Currently, Casmium only supports baseball data, but support for other sports is on the roadmap. The Casmium web platform and mobile app are both built in React (React.js and Native) while data and accounts are stored using Google's Firebase API.
