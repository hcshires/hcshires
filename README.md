# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I'm Henry Shires

I'm Henry Shires, a future Computer Engineer studying at Iowa State University who's invested in all things technology. I have experience with websites, web apps, mobile apps, and APIs and will soon begin my digital logic and circuits studies. I'm even a partial owner of an LLC, and when I'm not in the lab or working on my business, I'm most likely grooving with my buddies in the drumline.
