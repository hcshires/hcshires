### Featured Project: Casmium

Casmium is a webapp for high school sports teams to upload and view gameplay data to improve strategy and performance in postseasons. Currently, Casmium only supports baseball pitching and hitting data, but is being worked on to support multiple sports with multiple types of data. Casmium is built in React.js, with a mobile app for data collection in React Native. Data and accounts are stored using Google's Firebase API.
